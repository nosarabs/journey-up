# **Upwards** 🎮✨

Welcome to **Upwards**, a top-down pixel art game focused on exploration, story, and memorable characters. This is my personal journey on exploring game developement, from pixels to code to music.

## **About the Game** 🎮

**Upwards** is an exploration-based game where the player moves upward through a map divided into seasonal-themed areas. The journey focuses on storytelling and character-building, with each season representing a unique environment and experience.

### **Key Features:**

- **Seasonal Environments:** Explore four distinct seasonal areas in the game, each with its own challenges and unique aesthetic.
- **Story-Driven Gameplay:** Dive deep into the story as you progress through the game, uncovering character-driven narratives.
- **Pixel Art Style:** Beautiful (hopefully) pixel art that brings the world of *Upwards* to life.
- **Solo Developed:** All aspects of the game, including art, code, and music, are being created by me.

## **Technologies Used** 💻

This project is being built with the following technologies:

- **MonoGame**: A cross-platform game development framework for creating 2D and 3D games. (For learning low-level game development and improving coding skills)
  - Subject to change because I'm a noob.
- **Pixel Art**: Custom pixel art made by me for the game’s characters, environments, and objects.
- **Music**: Original music and sound effects.
  - Subject to change because I'm also a noob.

## **Development Progress** 🛠️

The game is in active development, and I'll be documenting my progress on this devlog. Here’s a quick look at what’s been done so far:

- **[Devlog #1 — The Journey Begins](posts/the-journey-begins.html)**: Introduction to the project and the start of my development journey.
<!-- - **[Devlog #2 — Exploring Art and Code](posts/devlog-2.html)**: Discussing the process of creating pixel art and starting to build the game world. -->

Future updates will include more detailed entries about game mechanics, new features, and other creative challenges.

I have no idea what I'm doing.
